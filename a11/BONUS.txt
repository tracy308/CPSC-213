Most people in general waited less in well_sem compared to well.
In the well.c, we used cond, as such the signal must be after the wait.
However, implementing semaphores allows the signaling to be called ahead of time,
such that we only need to have n signals for n drinkers.
Therefore, in the original version, the drinkers waited for longer and more signaling are used,
such as to protect the critical sections/prevent race conditions that resulted in deadlocks.
