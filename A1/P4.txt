Cases to test
- 00 00 00 00 -> Base Case
- 00 00 00 01 -> big endian value should be one
- 01 00 00 00 -> little endian value should be one
- 00 00 00 80 -> big endian value should be positive & little endian will be smallest possible int value
- 80 00 00 00 -> little endian value should be positive & big endian will be smallest possible int value
- 7F FF FF FF -> big endian value should be largest possible value
- FF FF FF 7F -> little endian value should be largest possible value
- 12 34 34 12 -> little endian and big endian should have the same value
- FF FF FF FF -> largest possible hex number with 4 bytes; both little and big endian value should be -1
